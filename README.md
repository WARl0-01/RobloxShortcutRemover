# RobloxShortcutRemover
Roblox has an issue where every time it updates it creates a new shortcut. It will even update roblox studio and make a shortcut for that. Uninstalling studio doesnt help either. And for many people this is really annoything. I'm like that so I just made a program to delete the shortcuts automatically. I wont write any thing about my code here because my code is very well commented. If you need help please read the code. Its only 37 lines of actual code, the rest is spaces to break things up, and hundreds of words of comments. Please make issue requests if you have an issue
